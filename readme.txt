'Make Tabbloid' integrates with the www.tabbloid.com service to create printer friendly 'tabloid' editions of your Wordpress blog in an attractive magazine/newspaper format.

== Description ==

The 'Make Tabbloid' plugin integrates with HP's [Tabbloid Service](http://www.tabbloid.com) to automatically create printer friendly 'tabloid' editions of your Wordpress blog in an attractive magazine/newspaper format.

The plugin includes a widget to let you control how you advertise your 'tabloid edition'. You can also choose to display a thumbnail of your custom newlestter (powered by [http://view.samurajdata.se/](http://view.samurajdata.se/)) to let your readers see what they are missing. 

If widgets aren't your thing you can call the makeTabbloid function from your template.

'Make Tabbloid' can easily be configured to add additional RSS feeds if you want to combine posts from other blogs.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the `make-tabbloid` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to [http://www.tabbloid.com/developer](http://www.tabbloid.com/developer) and 'agree to do no evil' then click on 'Make me cool' to get an API key
1. Via the 'Settings' menu enter your Tabbloid API key and then add the RSS feed of your blog
1. You can then either add Make Tabbloid to your sidebar as a widget or by placing `<?php makeTabbloid('linkName','fileName', showThumbnail); ?>` in your template

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is my PDF file blank =

Either [Tabbloid](http://www.tabbloid.com) is struggling with your RSS feed or your feed is making its way to the front of the queue to be tabloided. Try going to www.tabbloid.com, adding your feed url and clicking 'Generate sample issue now'. If it doesn't generate a PDF either wait an hour and try again or drop a line to the techies at Tabbloid.    

= When I add or remove a feed the list in settings doesn't update =

It can take www.tabbloid.com a couple of seconds to update it's cache. Wait a couple of seconds before refreshing.

= Why doesn't the thumbnail appear?  =

The thumbnail is generated by [http://view.samurajdata.se/](http://view.samurajdata.se/) and either my code is a bit flaky or there are problems on the 3rd party site.
