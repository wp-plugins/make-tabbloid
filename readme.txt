'Make Tabbloid' integrates with the www.tabbloid.com service to create printer friendly 'tabloid' edition of your Wordpress blog.

== Description ==

The 'Make Tabbloid' plugin integrates with HP's [Tabbloid Service](http://www.tabbloid.com) to automatically create printer friendly 'tabloid' editions of your Wordpress blog in an attractive magazine/newspaper format.

The plugin includes a widget to let you control how you advertise your 'tabloid edition'. You can also choose to display a thumbnail of your custom newlestter (powered by [http://view.samurajdata.se/](http://view.samurajdata.se/)) to let your readers see what they are missing. 

*NEW!* - You can now customise the banner text of your pdf publication (default is Today's Tabbloid)

If widgets aren't your thing you can call the makeTabbloid function from your template.

'Make Tabbloid' can easily be configured to add additional RSS feeds if you want to combine posts from other blogs.

For an example of its usage visit [http://www.rsc-ne-scotland.org.uk/mashe/](http://www.rsc-ne-scotland.org.uk/mashe/) 


== Installation ==

1. Upload the `make-tabbloid` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to [http://www.tabbloid.com/developer](http://www.tabbloid.com/developer) and 'agree to do no evil' then click on 'Make me cool' to get an API key
1. Via the 'Settings' menu enter your Tabbloid API key and then add the RSS feed of your blog
1. You can then either add Make Tabbloid to your sidebar as a widget or by placing `<?php do_makeTabbloid('linkName','fileName', showThumbnail, 'bannerTitle'); ?>` in your template

The script needs write access to your Blog directory. Check out the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions) or have a look at the FAQ for help.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I get an fopen error and / or permission denied =

If you get permission errors make sure that the script has writing rights in your blog directory. Try to creating a file with your chosen pdf filename (e.g. mytabbloid.pdf) manually, upload it with a ftp program and set the rights to 777 with CHMOD. A good tutorial for changing file permissions can be found on the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions).

= Why is my PDF file blank =

Either [Tabbloid](http://www.tabbloid.com) is struggling with your RSS feed or your feed is making its way to the front of the queue to be tabloided. Try going to www.tabbloid.com, adding your feed url and clicking 'Generate sample issue now'. If it doesn't generate a PDF either wait an hour and try again or drop a line to the techies at Tabbloid.    


= Why doesn't the thumbnail appear?  =

The thumbnail is generated by [http://view.samurajdata.se/](http://view.samurajdata.se/) so there may by a problem with the 3rd party site. Images are also cached for 3 days so changes may take this long to filter through.

== Upgrading ==

If you used version 0.9.2 or earlier and used the function makeTabbloid('linkName','fileName', showThumbnail) in your template you will need to change this to do_makeTabbloid('linkName','fileName', showThumbnail, 'bannerTitle').
